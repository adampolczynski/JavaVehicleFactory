# JavaVehicleFactory
Really simple, multi-threaded Java application acting as 'Vehicle factory' basing on XML input.

## How to launch it
You can use some IDE like Eclipse or just console, I'll write about console here (linux).

In root project folder:
1) mkdir bin
2) javac src/**/\*.java src/\*.java -d bin/
3) cd bin
4) java VehicleFactory
5) program is running, give path to XML file. (../order.xml by default, attached in project)

Have fun.
